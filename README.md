# Musica

A web application where you can vote the tracks of your favorites.

## Setup Instructions

Clone the repository. It contains both the frontend and the backend, so the backend directory can be moved and deployed separately if needed.

# Frontend Configuration

### Requirements

- Node.js and npm

### Steps to Set Up the Frontend

1. **Clone the Repository**

```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd musica
```

2. **Install dependencies**

```bash
   npm install
```

3. **Run the Development Server**
   To start the Next.js development server, run:

```bash
    npm run dev
```

This command will start the server and you can access the application in your browser at http://localhost:3000.

4. **Build the Project**
   To create an optimized production build of the application, run:

```bash
npm run build
```

This command generates a .next folder containing the compiled application.

5. **Start the Production Server**
   After building the project, you can start the production server with:

```bash
npm start
```

This command runs the built application. By default, it will be accessible at http://localhost:3000.

6. **Run Tests**
   If you have tests set up for your Next.js project, you can run them using:

```bash
npm test
```
